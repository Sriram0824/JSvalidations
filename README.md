# JSvalidations
A simple project designed to demonestrate the use of freont end validation along with backend validations. Sometimes there is a chance of users turning off the javascript and provide unwanted inputs. This could lead a serious problems like sql injection so, it is always better to have a second level of security at the backend checking the input fields.

1. Created a page called Registration.php for filling the form
2. used jquery to validate the fields and the js file is validate.js
3. Also validated the form fields in the backend using php in doRegistration.php
4. Once the fields are validated the form data can be emailed using php mailer and Success.php is displayed.
5. You can change the sender email and password in the doRegistration.php page.
